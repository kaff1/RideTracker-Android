RideTracker-Android
===================

Android side of RideTracker. Connects with a Pebble to allow for easy controls and at-a-glance information when recording a route. I built it for use on my motorbike, since it's difficult to mess around with a smartphone while on a bike but I'm sure there are other use cases.
